                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to <strong>RaggieSoft.com</strong>. I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it. This policy describes the minimal types of information I may collect from you when you visit this portfolio.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">2. Information I Collect</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 h6 fw-bold text-primary">A. Voluntary Information (Microsoft Bookings)</h3>
                    <p>I do not collect personal information (name, email, phone number) unless you explicitly provide it to me. The only interactive element on this site that requests this data is the <strong>Microsoft Bookings</strong> integration used for scheduling interviews or meetings. This data is processed by Microsoft and is accessed solely by me for the purpose of contacting you.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 h6 fw-bold text-primary">B. Automated Analytics (Google)</h3>
                    <p>This site uses <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to help me understand how visitors interact with my portfolio (e.g., which projects are viewed most). This service uses "cookies" to collect anonymous data such as your browser type, device type, and referral source. I do not use this data to identify you personally.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 h6 fw-bold text-primary">C. Server Logs (Security)</h3>
                    <p>Like most websites, my server ("Jessica") automatically logs requests to <code>/var/log/nginx/access.log</code>. This includes your IP address, user agent, and timestamp. These logs are retained briefly for security auditing and debugging purposes and are not shared with third parties.</p>

                    <h3 class="h5 h6 fw-bold text-primary">D. Infrastructure & Edge Security (Cloudflare)</h3>
                    <p>This website utilizes <strong>Cloudflare</strong> as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and security perimeter. Cloudflare acts as a reverse proxy, meaning your traffic passes through their global network before reaching my server. Cloudflare may collect data (including IP addresses and system configuration) to protect the site from DDoS attacks and malicious bots. They may also place strictly necessary cookies (e.g., <code>__cf_bm</code>) to verify that you are a human visitor.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">3. Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>This site contains links to external platforms (GitHub, LinkedIn, Spotify/Apple Music). Once you leave RaggieSoft.com, I am not responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites.</p>

                    <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">4. Contact Me</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">If you have questions about this policy, please reach out via the contact methods listed on my <a href="/contact">Contact Page</a>.</p>
