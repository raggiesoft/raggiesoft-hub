                    <p>
                        The tires of the Gateway Airlines jet touched down with a chirp of burning rubber.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tyler Wright checked his watch. "Wheels down. 08:30. We’re green on the timeline."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They didn't move to get their overhead bags. They didn't stand up to crowd the aisle. They waited. This was the protocol. The civilians left first; the Engine moved last.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the window seat, Ryan O'Connell looked out at the sun-bleached tarmac of the San Fernando Valley. He wasn't thinking about the meeting tomorrow. He was thinking about The Hilltop Observatory. He was thinking about the Santa Monica Pier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Vacation mode active," he whispered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Not yet," Holly O'Connell said from the aisle seat. She was already in "Manager Mode," checking her phone. There was no one to call back home—she was the management—but she was confirming their hotel reservation in Downtown LA. "We have to survive the gauntlet first. Then we can be tourists."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cassidy O'Connell sat between them. She adjusted her glasses, her leg bouncing slightly—a nervous tic common with her cerebral palsy. She reached out, brushing her thumb against the fabric of Ryan’s blazer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I'm good, Cass," Ryan said softly. "Systems normal."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aisle cleared. A flight attendant nodded to them. "We have the aisle chair ready, folks."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "No need," Evan Wright said, standing up and blocking the aisle like a boulder in a stream. "We gate-checked the Carbon. Bring it to the door."
                    </p>

                    <hr class="border-secondary opacity-25 my-5">

                    <h5 class="text-primary fw-bold text-uppercase mb-4">The Tarmac</h5>
                    
                    <p>
                        Valley Regional was Ryan’s favorite airport for one specific reason: No Jetways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan transferred from the aisle chair to his custom Carbon-Fiber Veloce at the aircraft door. He felt the familiar click of his seat lock engaging. He pushed off the bulkhead, caught the rims of his wheels, and rolled down the switchback ramp into the warm California morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Temperature is rising," Holly noted, stepping onto the tarmac behind him. "It’s going to be ninety degrees by noon. Hydrate."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan grabbed the water bottle from the side pouch of his chair without breaking his pushing rhythm. "Way ahead of you."
                    </p>

                                <strong>Formation Protocol:</strong> Cassidy moved to his right. She didn't walk beside him; she walked with him. Her left hand rested firmly on the push-handle of his wheelchair. She didn't push him—Ryan didn't need pushing—but she used the sturdy, carbon-fiber frame as a rolling walker. It was a symbiotic machine.

                        They moved as a phalanx through the outdoor baggage claim. Tyler and Evan flanked the group, grabbing the five Titan Cases containing their "tourist gear" (and the suits for tomorrow) from the carousel.

                    <p>
                        They approached the exit. A line of exhausted travelers was queuing up at the rental kiosks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We should have just told them 'No' on the phone," Ryan said, scanning the curb. "We're here to see the Space Shuttle Horizon, not a boardroom."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We're here to do both," Holly corrected. "We take the meeting because they're paying for the hotel. We reject the offer because they're idiots. Then we spend three days eating tacos. That is efficiency."

                        A man in a black suit stepped out from behind a concrete pillar. He was holding an mPad. "I'm Marcus," the driver said, flashing a service-industry smile. "Mr. Frost arranged for your ground transport."

                        The air on the curb didn't just drop; it froze. Cassidy flinched. She physically recoiled, her hand jerking off Ryan’s wheelchair handle as if it had burned her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-light">
                        "No," Cassidy whispered, her breathing hitching. "No. Not again. I'm not... he's my..."

                        She looked at Ryan, terror in her eyes. It was 1992 all over again. The photo shoot. The mirror. The clipboard.

                    <p class="text-light">
                        Evan and Tyler Wright stepped forward instantly. They didn't cross their arms this time; they dropped their bags. The thud of the heavy Titan Cases hitting the concrete sounded like a warning shot.

                        "Turn that screen off," Tyler growled.

                        Ryan O'Connell stopped rolling. His expression went from "vacation mode" to "cold dead stare" in a fraction of a second.

                        The subway ride from Union Station had been uneventful. They surfaced into the blinding Los Angeles sun and walked two blocks to the hotel. It wasn't the Grand Monarch where Omni-Global had tried to stick them. It was The Metropolitan Suites.

                    <p>
                        Holly walked to the front desk. She didn't slap down a corporate card. She pulled out her own Engine Room Records debit card.

                    <p>
                        "The Monarch," Holly whispered in the elevator, "has a master account controlled by Jameson Frost. The minute we walk out of that meeting tomorrow, he'll cancel the rooms and lock us out."

                        Holly didn't argue. She simply pulled out a heavy, black RFID keycard with a silver holographic column and held it to the reader. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The guard glanced at his console monitor. His posture straightened instantly. He saw the <strong class="text-success">"AUTHORIZED AGENT: PACIFIC RIM PROPERTIES"</strong> flag. He didn't know her face, but he knew the hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "My apologies, ma'am," the guard said, immediately stepping aside and holding his arm out to clear the path. "Elevator C is priority-locked for you. Have a good morning."
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="alert alert-secondary border-0 small fst-italic my-3">
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-elevator me-2"></i><strong>Security Note:</strong> The elevator button panel skipped "2" entirely. The "Phantom Second Floor" was a mechanical mezzanine, accessible only via freight elevators in the rear corridor. 
                        <br><br>
                        Holly's RFID badge unlocked the hidden service menu. If she wanted to, she could take her family into the guts of the building. Instead, she pressed <strong>3</strong>.

                    <hr class="border-secondary opacity-25 my-4">

                    <p>
                        The elevator doors opened onto the <strong>Third Floor Mezzanine</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the only suite on the level. The reception desk for <strong>Pacific Rim Properties (Suite 300)</strong> didn't face a blank wall; it faced a sweeping glass balcony rail that looked directly down into the main atrium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From her desk, Elena—the on-site manager—could see everyone who entered the building. The Landlord wasn't just in the tower; the Landlord was watching the door.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        "Welcome to the West Coast office," Elena said, standing up. She handed Holly a single, heavy document folder. "Printed on the 32lb linen stock, silver embossed. Just like you asked."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly opened the folder. She ran her finger over the textured paper. It made a sharp <em>snap</em>. It was the Eviction Notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Perfect," Holly said, sliding it into her briefcase. "And the network?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Whitelisted on the Building Management VLAN. You have Tier 1 priority."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Good. If Jameson Frost wants a presentation, I’m going to give him one."
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        The Penthouse lobby smelled like money. The receptionist looked at their polo shirts and Ryan’s wheelchair with undisguised confusion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        "Can I... help you?" she asked, hand hovering over the silent alarm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        "We have a 9:30 with Jameson Frost," Holly said. "The O'Connell Family."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        The receptionist checked her screen and frowned. "I have a 'Stardust Engine' listed? And a 'Mr. & Mrs. O'Connell'?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Cassidy flinched behind Ryan. Ryan tapped her hand. <em>Stable platform.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        Holly looked at the receptionist. For a split second, the "Shark" almost surfaced. She wanted to correct the record. She wanted to snap that they were the landlords.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        But she stopped.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        If Jameson Frost thought they were a desperate, scrappy garage band looking for a savior, she would let him think that. It would make the eviction notice in her briefcase hurt so much more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white fw-bold mt-4">
                        "That's us," Holly said, forcing a polite, diffident smile—the smile of a girl hoping for a big break. She adjusted her grip on the briefcase, feeling the weight of the linen paper inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white fw-bold">
                        "Please tell Mr. Frost we're ready."
