                        <strong>LOCATION:</strong> Executive Sales Office, Sainte-Claire Coachworks.<br>
                        <strong>CONTEXT:</strong> The band is in the middle of their 2002 "Trans-Canada" Tour. They have just played three sold-out nights in Montréal, performing strictly in French to honor the local culture.

                    <p>
                        Michel, the VP of Sales, rubbed his temples. He had just gotten off the phone with the manager of a major American Pop Star who was screaming in English about "Jacuzzi weight limits."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The door opened. Holly O'Connell (Age 33) walked in. She didn't have an entourage. She didn't have a translator. She was holding a bag of bagels from St-Viateur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Holly (in flawless Québécois):</strong> "Bonjour, Michel. Désolée du retard, le trafic sur la 20 était l'enfer." <br>
                        <span class="small text-muted">(Hi Michel. Sorry I'm late, traffic on the 20 was hell.)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Michel blinked. He sat up straighter. "Madame O'Connell? You... speak our language?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Holly:</strong> "We just re-recorded our entire setlist in French so CHOM 97.7 could play us during the drive-time block. We don't do things halfway, Michel."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She sat down and slid a folder across the desk. It wasn't a rider full of demands. It was a structural engineering schematic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-body-secondary">
                        "I know you have a waitlist," Holly said (still in French). "I know the Pop Star wants a swimming pool. I just want a chassis that won't twist when I put a 400-pound lift in the side door. I want steel, Michel. Just steel."
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <strong>The Outcome:</strong> Michel canceled the Pop Star's order that afternoon citing "irreconcilable engineering differences." He moved the O'Connell "Iron Horse" to Bay 1 immediately.

                        When Holly returned 16 years later to commission <strong>Unit 01 (The Sovereign)</strong>, the factory didn't ask for a deposit.

                        The floor crew remembered the American band that ate smoked meat with them in the breakroom and spoke their language. They started cutting the steel before the contract was even signed.
