                        <strong>LOCATION:</strong> Executive Sales Office, Sainte-Claire Coachworks.<br>
                        <strong>CONTEXT:</strong> The Music Industry is at its peak (CD era). Every label is ordering fleets. The waitlist for a custom "H-Series" chassis is 24 months.

                        Holly O'Connell (Age 33) walked into the office of Michel, the VP of Sales. She didn't have an appointment. She had a briefcase and a translator (though she understood the French perfectly).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Michel:</strong> "Madame, the waitlist is two years. We are building busses for [Major Pop Star] and [Famous Rock Band]. We cannot bump you."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Holly:</strong> "I don't want a bus. I want a tank that looks like a bus. And I want the frame modified <em>before</em> the shell goes on."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She slid a cashier's check across the desk. It was for the full purchase price of the chassis, plus a 40% "Expedited Engineering" fee.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-body-secondary">
                        "There is a pop star in Line 1," Holly said calmly. "He wants a jacuzzi in the back. That implies water weight. That implies frame stress. I predict his order will be... problematic. My order is simple: Steel. Hydraulics. Safety."

                    <strong>The Handshake:</strong> Michel canceled the Pop Star's order that afternoon citing "engineering incompatibility." He put the O'Connell "Iron Horse" into production immediately.

                        When Holly returned 16 years later to commission <strong>Unit 01 (The Sovereign)</strong>, she didn't have to introduce herself.

                        Michel (now the VP of Operations) walked out onto the factory floor.
