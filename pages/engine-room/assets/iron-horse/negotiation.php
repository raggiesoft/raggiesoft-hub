                        <strong>LOCATION:</strong> Executive Sales Office, Sainte-Claire Coachworks.<br>
                        <strong>CONTEXT:</strong> The band is in the middle of their 2002 "Trans-Canada" Tour. They have just played three sold-out nights in Montréal, performing strictly in French.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Michel, the VP of Sales, rubbed his temples. He had just gotten off the phone with the manager of a major American Pop Star who was screaming in English about "Jacuzzi weight limits."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The door opened. Holly O'Connell (Age 33) walked in. She held the door open.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan O'Connell (Age 31) rolled in past her. He maneuvered his manual chair with precision, turning to face the desk. He wasn't wearing sunglasses or a stage costume. He was wearing a flannel shirt and jeans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Holly (in flawless Québécois):</strong> "Bonjour, Michel. Désolée du retard, le trafic sur la 20 était l'enfer." <br>
                        <span class="small text-body-secondary">(Hi Michel. Sorry I'm late, traffic on the 20 was hell.)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Michel blinked. He looked from the woman to the man in the wheelchair. "Madame O'Connell? Monsieur O'Connell? You... speak our language?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Ryan (smiling, extending a hand):</strong> "On voulait pas vous forcer à parler anglais chez vous. C'est une question de respect."<br>
                        <span class="small text-body-secondary">(We didn't want to force you to speak English in your own home. It's a matter of respect.)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly sat down and slid a folder across the desk. It wasn't a rider full of demands. It was a structural engineering schematic for a heavy-duty hydraulic lift installation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-body-emphasis">
                        "I know you have a waitlist," Holly said (still in French). "I know the Pop Star wants a swimming pool. That is dead weight. <strong>This</strong>..." she gestured to her brother, "...is precious cargo."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I don't need a party bus, Michel. I need a chassis that won't twist when I put a 400-pound industrial lift in the side door. I need steel."
                    </p>
                </div>

                <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-simple me-3 fs-3 text-success"></i>
                <div>
                    <strong>The Outcome:</strong> Michel canceled the Pop Star's order that afternoon citing "irreconcilable engineering differences." He moved the O'Connell "Iron Horse" to Bay 1 immediately.

                        When Holly returned 16 years later to commission <strong>Unit 01 (The Sovereign)</strong>, the factory didn't ask for a deposit.

                        The floor crew remembered the American band that ate smoked meat with them in the breakroom and spoke their language. They started cutting the steel before the contract was even signed.
