            <p class="fs-5 text-white-75">
                The "Anchor". Holly (Age 18 in 1987) is the most formidable member of The Stardust Engine, and she has never played a note on stage. A child prodigy, she accelerated her education to start college at 16, allowing her to join her older siblings and cousins at CPI.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-75">
                While still a student, she took on the role of the band's manager. Her official role was to act as the emotional peacemaker—famously pulling Ryan and Cassidy into a "three-way hug" when they argued over music, reminding them "You're both right. And you're both idiots."

            <p class="text-white-75">
                When Ryan was paralyzed in December 1990, Holly's role expanded from Business Manager to Medical Director. She holds <strong>Durable Power of Attorney</strong> for Ryan, giving her the legal authority to make medical decisions in an emergency. She carries signed, notarized HIPAA release forms in her briefcase at all times.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3 text-white">The "Friction" Nuke (1992)</h3>
            <p class="text-white-75">
                Holly's true power was revealed during the 1992 "Friction" scandal. By this time, she was a 2L law student. When Julian Vance made his criminal demand, Holly transformed into "Holly the Shark". She secured the evidence that forced Apex Records to surrender the masters, using the freedom to found <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>.

                        In 1996, when Cassidy handed her the winning lottery ticket worth <strong>$2.04 Billion</strong>, Holly didn't celebrate. She went to work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white-75">
                        "Money destroys families," she famously said. To prevent that, she spent the next two decades armoring herself with every credential available. She created the <strong>Forger Nation Trust</strong>, a structure that renders the band members "penniless" on paper—protecting them from lawsuits—while the Trust manages their empire.
