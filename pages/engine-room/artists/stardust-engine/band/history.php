                    The story begins at <strong>Commonwealth Polytechnic Institute (CPI)</strong> in Blacksburg. The five members (O'Connells and Wrights) formed a protective, insular unit—a "fortress"—to survive the academic and social pressures of the Class of '89.

                <p class="text-white-75">
                    Their early success attracted <strong>Apex Records</strong>, leading to a five-year "Cold War" over the band's identity. Apex wanted a pop band; The Stardust Engine wanted to be industrial rockers. This era was defined by "malicious compliance," hiding dark lyrics inside polished pop songs.

                    In 1992, an Apex executive attempted to exploit the sibling bond between Ryan and Cassidy for a sexualized marketing campaign. The resulting confrontation—the "Dirty Mirror" incident—ended with Holly O'Connell (then a law student) forcing the label to void the contract.

                    Late one night, returning from a gig in Lexington, the band stopped at a gas station in Daleville for snacks. <strong>Cassidy O'Connell</strong> bought a "Quick Pick" lottery ticket on a whim. She liked the visual pattern of the numbers.
