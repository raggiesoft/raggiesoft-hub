            1985-1987: The Ironhead Origins

                    The story begins at <strong>Commonwealth Polytechnic Institute (CPI)</strong> in Blacksburg, Virginia. Through a combination of delayed entry (Ryan) and academic acceleration (Holly), all five family members—siblings Ryan, Cassidy, and Holly O'Connell, and their cousins Evan and Tyler Wright—managed to enter the <strong>Class of '89</strong> together.
                </p>
                <p class="text-white-75">
                    This wasn't just about school; it was about survival. Ryan and Cassidy, both navigating the world with autism, relied on each other (and their sister Holly) as their designated "Safe Person." The five of them formed a protective, insular unit—a "fortress" long before they had a name for it.
                </p>
                <p class="text-white-75">
                    They weren't just students; they were "Ironheads." In 1986, they wrote <strong>"Ignition (The Forger's Call),"</strong> an industrial-rock anthem donated to the university's football team. When 60,000 fans at "The Crucible" adopted it as their sacred entrance music, the band became local legends before they ever signed a contract.

            Their success at CPI attracted <strong>Apex Records</strong>, a major label looking for the next big synth-pop act. This began a five-year "Cold War" over the band's identity.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-75">
            Apex created reductive personas: Cassidy was "The Stardust" (the pop princess) and Ryan was "The Engine" (the rock grunt). The label actively suppressed their heavier sound, leading to a series of albums defined by "malicious compliance," where the band would hide anti-corporate lyrics inside polished pop songs like <em>Plastic Sky</em> and <em>Hollow Sound</em>.

                <p class="text-white-75">
                    In 1992, during pre-production for their third album, <em>Friction</em>, the conflict with Apex reached a breaking point. A new executive made a "fatal assumption" about the band's dynamic. He mistook the profound, comfortable intimacy between Ryan and Cassidy—born of a lifetime of caregiving and being each other's "Safe Person"—for something romantic.
                </p>
                <p class="text-white-75">
                    He attempted to push a marketing narrative that sexualized their bond, violating their integrity as siblings in the most offensive way possible. The result was explosive. <strong>Holly O'Connell</strong> (then a law student) and <strong>Ryan O'Connell</strong> drew a line in the sand. They didn't just reject the marketing; they "nuked" the relationship.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0 text-white-75">
                    Apex Records, facing a legal and PR nightmare, voided the contract and surrendered the master tapes. The band was free, but they were effectively blacklisted and broke.

                    Penniless but free, the band retreated to a warehouse in Blacksburg they dubbed "The Fortress." They were saved by the <strong>"Forger Nation War Chest,"</strong> a grassroots fundraising campaign by their loyal college fanbase.
