                        <strong>Ryan O’Connell</strong> sat center stage. His rig was modified for high-G maneuvers—heavy-duty cargo straps locked his wheelchair to the deck plates, and a 5-point harness was secured over his chest. To his left, <strong>Cassidy</strong> braced herself against her synth rack, watching the telemetry monitor.

                        When the thrusters hit, the floorplates vibrated at 40Hz. Tyler didn't fight the rumble—he matched it. The band kicked into the driving rhythm of "Ignition," turning the physical G-force of the ascent into a wall of sound.
