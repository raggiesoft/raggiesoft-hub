                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        In 1992, Apex Records assigned a new Executive Producer, <strong>Julian Vance</strong>, to the band. Julian looked at the roster, saw "Ryan O'Connell" and "Cassidy O'Connell," and made the lazy, catastrophic assumption that they were a married couple.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        He based this entire theory on a single 1989 promo photo where the two were physically close. He interpreted their lack of personal space as sexual chemistry. He was wrong. It was <em>medical necessity</em> and <em>neurological safety</em>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="card bg-dark border-secondary mb-4">

                            <p class="card-text small text-white-50 mb-2">
                                Ryan's T10 paralysis requires complex, 24/7 care managed by his sisters. But beyond the medicine, both Ryan and Cassidy are <strong>autistic</strong>. They are each other's "Safe Person."
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text small text-white-50 mb-0">
                                They rely on close physical contact—hugs, leaning, cuddling—for sensory regulation and grounding. Julian Vance looked at a family unit built on survival, safety, and non-sexual intimacy, and projected his own perversion onto it.

                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        When Julian pitched the working title <strong>"Friction,"</strong> the band was ecstatic. They immediately interpreted it as the scientific friction of a space shuttle re-entering Earth's atmosphere. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        They went into the studio and recorded <strong>"Atmosphere,"</strong> a heavy industrial track about heat shields and orbital decay. They sent the demo to Julian. He heard lyrics like "burning up" and "shaking frame" and assumed they were playing along with his sexual metaphor. He never corrected them. He wanted to ambush them.

                                At the photo shoot, Julian revealed his true vision. He rejected the space theme entirely. He handed Ryan a lyric sheet for a new song called <strong>"Friction."</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-body-secondary">
                                It wasn't about rockets. The lyrics demanded that Ryan and Cassidy sing about—and sound like they were engaging in—actual sexual intercourse.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-3 fw-bold text-body-emphasis">
                                He then pointed to the set—a mattress on the floor—and told the photographer to capture "Shot 12: The Act."

                                <strong>The Photographer's Horror:</strong> The photographer, Kevin Mitchell, froze. He was a local commercial photographer best known for shooting <strong>Mall Santa portraits</strong> and family Christmas cards. He had been hired by Apex under the pretense of a "Wholesome Family Band" shoot. He had no idea what Julian had planned.

                        Ryan O'Connell didn't just say no. He famously threw the lyric sheet into the "dirty mirror" pile of fake cocaine Julian had set up.

                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Julian sneered, still thinking it was a negotiation tactic. "Everyone has a price, Ryan. Look at the chair. You need the money."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        That was the moment <strong>Holly O'Connell</strong> stepped out of the shadows. She wasn't just a sister anymore. She was a 23-year-old law student who had just passed her Torts final. She didn't scream. She simply cited the California Penal Code regarding "Solicitation of a Felony" and ordered the photographer to hand over the film.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Kevin Mitchell, the "Mall Santa" photographer, gladly handed the film to Holly. He wanted no evidence that he was ever in that room.
