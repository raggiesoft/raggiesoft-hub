                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        In 1992, Apex Records assigned a new Executive Producer, <strong>Julian Vance</strong>, to the band. Julian looked at the roster, saw "Ryan O'Connell" and "Cassidy O'Connell," and made the lazy, catastrophic assumption that they were a married couple.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        He based this entire theory on a single 1989 promo photo where the two were physically close. He interpreted their lack of personal space as sexual chemistry. He was wrong. It was <em>medical necessity</em> and <em>neurological safety</em>.

                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        When Julian pitched the working title <strong>"Friction,"</strong> the band was ecstatic. They immediately interpreted it as the scientific friction of a space shuttle re-entering Earth's atmosphere. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        They went into the studio and recorded <strong>"Atmosphere,"</strong> a heavy industrial track about heat shields and orbital decay. They sent the demo to Julian. He heard lyrics like "burning up" and "shaking frame" and assumed they were playing along with his sexual metaphor. He never corrected them. He wanted to ambush them.

                            They didn't pick it for the "Just Say No" message—they were a straight-edge family who lived on hot chocolate; the moral lesson was irrelevant to them. They picked it for <strong>efficiency</strong>. It was the only tape in the pile that packed <em>every single one</em> of their favorite Saturday Morning characters into a crisp 30-minute runtime. They were in full "kid mode," happily nerding out over the crossover event, completely oblivious to the adult nightmare walking through the door.

                                <strong>MITCHELL:</strong> The band was huddled together for warmth. It was freezing in there. A PA walked over with a silver tray. Julian had sent it—champagne, flutes, and a mirror covered in white powder with a rolled-up hundred-dollar bill.

                                <strong>MITCHELL:</strong> Total confusion. They had just spent twenty minutes debating which cartoon chipmunk had better comedic timing. Ryan looked at the mirror like it was a health code violation. He said, "It's filthy."
                            </p>

                                <strong>MITCHELL:</strong> No. He thought it was drywall dust from the ceiling. Before the PA could stop him, Ryan grabbed a cocktail napkin and wiped the mirror clean. He dumped $500 of Julian's cocaine into the trash and asked for a broom. The PA looked like he was going to faint.

                                Julian Vance arrived moments later. He saw the clean mirror and the trash can, but he pushed forward. He rejected Cassidy's space shuttle drawing. He handed Ryan a lyric sheet for a new song called <strong>"Friction."</strong>

She simply cited the California Penal Code regarding "Solicitation of a Felony" and ordered the photographer to hand over the film.
