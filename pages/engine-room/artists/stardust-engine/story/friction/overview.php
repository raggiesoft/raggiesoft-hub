                    In 1992, the music industry was obsessed with <strong>"Shock Value."</strong>
                    Superstar <strong>Cydele</strong> was dominating the charts with her album <em>Sanctuary</em> and its controversial companion book. Apex Records wanted to compete.

                    They hired "rogue agent" <strong>Julian Vance</strong> to find their own "Sex Sells" act. Julian looked at The Stardust Engine's 1989 promo photo, saw two attractive leads with intense chemistry, and made a catastrophic error: <strong>He assumed they were a couple.</strong>

                                When Julian pitched the title <em>Friction</em>, the band was ecstatic. They thought the label was finally letting them do a sci-fi concept album.

                                Cassidy drew this cover art depicting the <strong>thermal friction</strong> of a shuttle hull re-entering the atmosphere. They wrote the song "Atmosphere" about the violence of physics, not passion.

                    <strong>Friction</strong> was permanently canceled. The band was free. Holly O'Connell founded <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>, and the band, fueled by the trauma, retreated to their Blacksburg warehouse to record their true debut: 1995's <strong>The Warehouse Tapes.</strong>
