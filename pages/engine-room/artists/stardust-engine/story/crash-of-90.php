                They were trying to beat the storm. Fresh off a show in Wytheville, the band was racing the weather reports to get back to Blacksburg before the highways closed.

                <strong>Ryan was driving.</strong> He wouldn't let anyone else do it. He knew the trucks on I-81. He knew the "suicide lane" merges. He was doing everything right—40 MPH in the <strong>Holt Freighter</strong>, hazards on, white-knuckling the wheel while the rest of the family slept in the back.

            <p>
                It didn't matter. Another driver, impatient and inexperienced with the mountain pass, decided 40 was too slow. The impact was small, but on black ice, physics is unforgiving. The van didn't just slide; it tumbled.
