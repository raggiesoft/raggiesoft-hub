                    <p>
                        The tires of the Gateway Airlines Boeing 737 touched down with a chirp of burning rubber.

                    <p>
                        Tyler Wright checked his watch. "Wheels down. 08:30 local. We made up time over the Rockies."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It had been a brutal logistical sprint. The "Smoking Gun" letter had arrived in Blacksburg yesterday afternoon. By 6:00 PM, Holly had booked five last-minute First Class seats from <strong>Roanoke (ROA)</strong> to <strong>Burbank (BUR)</strong>, connecting through the Atlanta hub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Remind me why we're doing this?" Evan asked, stretching his massive frame into the aisle as the seatbelt sign pinged off. "We could have just shredded the letter."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly O'Connell didn't look up from her phone. She was calculating the Uber surge pricing in Los Angeles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Because he owes me fifty cents," Holly said. "He sent a hostile takeover threat using a bulk mail permit on a single envelope. The mail carrier made me pay the postage due."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She stood up, smoothing her blazer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I don't care about the $150 million offer. I care about the disrespect. We are going to walk into his office, look him in the eye, and make him give me two quarters."

                        In the window seat (1A), Ryan O'Connell looked out at the sun-bleached tarmac. For him, the First Class ticket wasn't a luxury; it was a medical necessity. The extra legroom allowed him to manage the spasms in his paralyzed legs during the five-hour flight from Atlanta.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Systems check," Ryan murmured. He shifted his weight, testing his balance. "Spasticity is manageable. Hydration is nominal."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cassidy sat in 1B. She adjusted her glasses, her leg bouncing slightly—a nervous tic common with her cerebral palsy. "Are we tourists yet?" she whispered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Not until we get the quarters," Ryan replied.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Valley Regional (BUR) was their airport of choice for one specific reason: <strong>Stairs, not Jetways.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gateway Airlines ground crew brought the aisle chair to the aircraft door, but Ryan waved them off. He saw his custom <strong>Carbon-Fiber Veloce</strong> wheelchair waiting at the bottom of the air-stairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Evan," Ryan said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evan didn't need instructions. He stepped up, scooped his brother into a fireman's carry with effortless practice, and carried him down the stairs to the tarmac. Tyler followed with the cushion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan transferred into his chair on the hot pavement. He clicked the seat lock. He pushed off the asphalt, spinning the chair around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Solid ground," Ryan said. "Let's go find our ride."

                        Valley Regional was Ryan’s favorite airport for one specific reason: No Jetways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan transferred from the aisle chair to his custom Carbon-Fiber Veloce at the aircraft door. He felt the familiar click of his seat lock engaging. He pushed off the bulkhead, caught the rims of his wheels, and rolled down the switchback ramp into the warm California morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Temperature is rising," Holly noted, stepping onto the tarmac behind him. "It’s going to be ninety degrees by noon. Hydrate."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan grabbed the water bottle from the side pouch of his chair without breaking his pushing rhythm. "Way ahead of you."

                                <strong>Formation Protocol:</strong> Cassidy moved to his right. She didn't walk beside him; she walked with him. Her left hand rested firmly on the push-handle of his wheelchair. She didn't push him—Ryan didn't need pushing—but she used the sturdy, carbon-fiber frame as a rolling walker. It was a symbiotic machine.

                        They moved as a phalanx through the outdoor baggage claim. Tyler and Evan flanked the group, grabbing the five Titan Cases containing their "tourist gear" (and the suits for tomorrow) from the carousel.

                        They approached the exit. A line of exhausted travelers was queuing up at the rental kiosks.

                        "We should have just told them 'No' on the phone," Ryan said, scanning the curb. "We're here to see the Space Shuttle Horizon, not a boardroom."

                    <p>
                        "We're here to do both," Holly corrected. "We take the meeting because they're paying for the hotel. We reject the offer because they're idiots. Then we spend three days eating tacos. That is efficiency."

                        The subway ride from Union Station had been uneventful. They surfaced into the blinding Los Angeles sun and walked two blocks to the hotel. It wasn't the Grand Monarch where Omni-Global had tried to stick them. It was The Metropolitan Suites.

                    <h5 class="text-danger fw-bold text-uppercase mb-4">The Armory</h5>

                    <p>
                        The lobby was designed to intimidate. A cathedral of glass and steel that stretched two full stories up, creating a vast, echoing vacuum of air designed to make human beings feel small.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Stardust Engine did not look small. They moved in formation, wearing their "Uniforms": Midnight Blue polos with the silver <em>Engine Room</em> gear logo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Target acquired," Ryan said. "Omni-Global Media. Penthouse."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We aren't going there yet," Holly said. "We have a stop to make."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They bypassed the main security desk for the restricted elevators. The guard, a serious man named Alvarez with twenty years on the job, stepped forward instantly. He raised a hand, blocking the path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Excuse me, folks," Alvarez said firmly. "Restricted elevators. I need you to step back to the Visitor Desk."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly didn't argue. She didn't explain. She simply reached into her pocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She pulled out a heavy, black RFID keycard with a silver holographic column and held it to the reader. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alvarez glanced at his console monitor. His eyebrows shot up. <strong class="text-success text-uppercase">TIER 1: AUTHORIZED AGENT.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Apologies, ma'am," he said, his tone shifting from enforcer to professional deference. "But I need all parties to badge in. No tailgating. Building policy."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly smiled. It was a genuine smile. "I appreciate that, Officer. Good protocol."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She stepped through the turnstile. Behind her, Ryan rolled forward. He tapped a card attached to a retractable reel on his hip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP.</em> <strong class="text-success text-uppercase small">TIER 1: AUTHORIZED AGENT.</strong>

                        Then Cassidy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP.</em>

                    <p>
                        Then Evan. Then Tyler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP. BEEP.</em>

                    <p>
                        Officer Alvarez stared at the screen. Five Tier 1 badges. Five "Owners." He looked back at the group in the matching polo shirts. They weren't tourists. They were an invasion force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Elevator C is priority-locked for you," Alvarez said, stepping aside and holding his arm out to clear the path. "Have a good morning, folks."
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="alert alert-secondary border-0 small fst-italic my-3">
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-elevator me-2"></i><strong>Security Note:</strong> The elevator button panel skipped "2" entirely. The "Phantom Second Floor" was a mechanical mezzanine, accessible only via freight elevators in the rear corridor.

                        Holly's RFID badge unlocked the hidden service menu. If she wanted to, she could take her family into the guts of the building. Instead, she pressed <strong>3</strong>.

                    <p>
                        The elevator doors opened onto the <strong>Third Floor Mezzanine</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was the only suite on the level. The reception desk for <strong>Pacific Rim Properties (Suite 300)</strong> didn't face a blank wall; it faced a sweeping glass balcony rail that looked directly down into the main atrium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From her desk, Elena—the on-site manager—could see everyone who entered the building. The Landlord wasn't just in the tower; the Landlord was watching the door.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        "Welcome to the West Coast office," Elena said, standing up. She handed Holly a single, heavy document folder. "Printed on the 32lb linen stock, silver embossed. Just like you asked."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly opened the folder. She ran her finger over the textured paper. It made a sharp <em>snap</em>. It was the Eviction Notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Perfect," Holly said, sliding it into her briefcase. "And the network?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Whitelisted on the Building Management VLAN. You have Tier 1 priority."

                    <p>
                        "Good. If Jameson Frost wants a presentation, I’m going to give him one."

                    <p class="lead">
                        The elevator doors opened onto the 40th floor, revealing a lobby that smelled of ozone and intimidation. The carpet was too thick. The lighting was too low. The silence was engineered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly O'Connell stepped out first, her heels sinking slightly into the plush wool. She adjusted her blazer, checking the alignment of her enamel pin. Behind her, the twins—Evan and Tyler—flanked the door like Secret Service agents, minus the earpieces and plus twenty years of roadie muscle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cassidy stayed close to the wall, her eyes scanning the exits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan rolled out last. His custom titanium rig hummed softly on the marble threshold before hitting the carpet. He hated thick carpet. It was like pushing through mud. He gave his rims a hard shove, propelling himself forward with a grunt of irritation.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="h5 fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3">The Reception Desk</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        The reception desk was a massive slab of polished obsidian, designed to look like it was floating. It was comically high—clearly built to make the person behind it look down on you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Check in," Holly whispered. "I'll handle the coats."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan rolled up to the desk. Because of the height, he was staring directly at the wood grain of the paneling. He couldn't see the person behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Excuse me," Ryan said, pitching his voice to cut through the ambient drone of the AC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A head popped up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was young. Painfully young. Maybe nineteen. She had dark hair pulled back into a severe bun that looked like it was giving her a headache. She was wearing a crisp white blouse that looked stiff and uncomfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Oh!" she squeaked, her eyes widening as she looked down at him. "I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't see you down there."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She scrambled to stand up. Or, she tried to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan watched the mechanics of her movement. He saw her hands grip the edge of the desk, knuckles white. He saw the way her shoulders hunched, taking the weight off her lower body. He heard the distinct <em>clack-scrape</em> of a footplate shifting under the desk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She wasn't standing up. She was repositioning.
                    </p>

                            I saw the chair. It was a standard-issue hospital clunker, probably tucked under the desk where no one could see it.

                            She was wearing black patent leather pumps. Three-inch heels. Pointy toes. I saw them when she shifted—her feet were strapped onto the footplates, the heels hooked precariously over the back edge to keep them from slipping. Her ankles were swollen.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        "I'm Jessica," she said, her voice trembling. She smoothed the front of her blouse, trying to look professional, trying to look like she wasn't currently in agony. "Welcome to Omni-Global. Do you... do you have an appointment?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan didn't answer immediately. He just looked at her. He looked at the high desk that cut her off at the neck. He looked at the thick carpet that would make it impossible for her to push that heavy hospital chair to the bathroom without help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He looked at the fear in her eyes. It was the fear of an intern who hadn't been paid in three months and was terrified that her disability would be the reason she was let go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Yeah," Ryan said, his voice softer than usual. "We're here to see Jameson Frost."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Mr. Frost is in the boardroom," Jessica said, typing frantically. "I'll... I'll let him know you're here."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan turned his chair around to face his family. Holly was watching him. She had seen him clock the receptionist. She raised an eyebrow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>We're taking her,</em> Ryan signaled with a subtle nod.

                        Holly nodded back. <em>We're taking her.</em>
