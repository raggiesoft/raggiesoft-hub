                    <p>
                        The tires of the Gateway Airlines Boeing 737 touched down with a chirp of burning rubber.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tyler Wright checked his watch. "Wheels down. 08:30 local. We made up time over the Rockies."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It had been a brutal logistical sprint. The "Smoking Gun" letter had arrived in Blacksburg yesterday afternoon. By 6:00 PM, Holly had booked five last-minute First Class seats from <strong>Roanoke (ROA)</strong> to <strong>Burbank (BUR)</strong>, connecting through the Atlanta hub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Remind me why we're doing this?" Evan asked, stretching his massive frame into the aisle as the seatbelt sign pinged off. "We could have just shredded the letter."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly O'Connell didn't look up from her phone. She was calculating the Uber surge pricing in Los Angeles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Because he owes me fifty cents," Holly said. "He sent a hostile takeover threat using a bulk mail permit on a single envelope. The mail carrier made me pay the postage due."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She stood up, smoothing her blazer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I don't care about the $150 million offer. I care about the disrespect. We are going to walk into his office, look him in the eye, and make him give me two quarters."

                        In the window seat (1A), Ryan O'Connell looked out at the sun-bleached tarmac. For him, the First Class ticket wasn't a luxury; it was a medical necessity. The extra legroom allowed him to manage the spasms in his paralyzed legs during the five-hour flight from Atlanta.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Systems check," Ryan murmured. He shifted his weight, testing his balance. "Spasticity is manageable. Hydration is nominal."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cassidy sat in 1B. She adjusted her glasses, her leg bouncing slightly—a nervous tic common with her cerebral palsy. "Are we tourists yet?" she whispered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Not until we get the quarters," Ryan replied.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Valley Regional (BUR) was their airport of choice for one specific reason: <strong>Stairs, not Jetways.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gateway Airlines ground crew brought the aisle chair to the aircraft door, but Ryan waved them off. He saw his custom <strong>Carbon-Fiber Veloce</strong> wheelchair waiting at the bottom of the air-stairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Evan," Ryan said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evan didn't need instructions. He stepped up, scooped his brother into a fireman's carry with effortless practice, and carried him down the stairs to the tarmac. Tyler followed with the cushion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan transferred into his chair on the hot pavement. He clicked the seat lock. He pushed off the asphalt, spinning the chair around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Solid ground," Ryan said. "Let's go find our ride."

                        A man in a black suit stepped out from behind a concrete pillar. He was holding an mPad. "I'm Marcus," the driver said, flashing a service-industry smile. "Mr. Frost arranged for your ground transport to the hotel."

                        <strong>Context:</strong> Ryan and Cassidy are brother and sister. Due to their closeness and shared history, lazy journalists have occasionally misidentified them as a couple. It is the single most offensive insult you can offer the family. It implies incest. It triggers profound trauma from the 1992 "Friction" scandal.
