                        At 10:14 AM, Jameson Frost clicked the remote. The screen flickered.

                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Up until this moment, the meeting had been tense but professional. Frost had insulted their business model, their "lack of debt," and their touring logistics. The family had endured it all with stoic amusement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Then <strong>Slide 14</strong> appeared.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-body-secondary">
                        Frost smiled. "We call this the 'Diamond in the Rough.' You have a track called <em>Escape Velocity</em>. Great vocals. Catchy hook. But it's fifteen minutes long. It's unlistenable. It's un-monetizable."
                    </p>

                        He pressed a button. A speaker on the conference table crackled to life.

                        It played a 30-second loop. Omni-Global producers had taken Cassidy's voice, stripped away the music, and layered it over a generic car-commercial beat. They had cut Ryan's guitar solo entirely.
