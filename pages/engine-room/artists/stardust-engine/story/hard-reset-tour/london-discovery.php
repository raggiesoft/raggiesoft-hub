                        It was sheer chance. Ryan O'Connell and Evan Wright had ducked into the basement club just to escape the London rain.

                        On stage, it wasn't a reunion; it was a ghost story. <strong>Origin</strong> had once been a massive six-piece art-rock orchestra. Now, only two remained: the singer and the flautist. Brother and sister.
