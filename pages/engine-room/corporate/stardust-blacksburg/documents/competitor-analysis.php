            <p class="lead text-body-secondary">
                We are consistently losing the "Tier 1" demographic (Engineering, Arch, Pre-Med) to Stardust Properties. Their waiting list is currently 14 months long. We cannot compete on price or infrastructure. We must pivot our marketing to exploit their strictness.
