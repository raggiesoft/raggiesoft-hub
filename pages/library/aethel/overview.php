// This will be the folder that contains the 1980s fantasy adventure I'm calling The Silver Gauntlet of Aethel
// It will be a series of pages that describe the world, characters, magic system, and plot overview.
// This is the overview page.
// We will have everything in this folder be about Aethel, and link to it from the main library page.
// From there, we also need to have the actual book content, which will be in a separate folder called "aethel-book" or something similar.
