                <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Throne Room of Aethel was not built for silence. It was a cathedral of light and sound, designed to amplify the very chaos Malakor sought to tame.
            </p>

            <p>
                Massive stained-glass windows, stretching from the marble floor to the vaulted ceiling, captured the twin lights of Sol-Aura and Lun-Argent. As the suns moved across the sky, beams of violet, gold, and azure swept across the court like the hands of a manic clock. Musicians played harps that hummed with the ambient magic of the air, and courtiers debated philosophy in loud, passionate voices.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was vibrant. It was alive. To Malakor, standing alone in the center of the chamber in his severe grey robes, it was a headache.
            </p>

            <p>
                "High Sage Malakor," King Theron boomed. The King was a large man, draped in silks of shifting colors, slouching comfortably on the Sun Throne. "You bring us news of the harvest? The farmers in the valley are anxious. Sol-Aura has been... enthusiastic this month."
            </p>

            <p>
                Malakor did not bow. He stood rigid, a singular vertical line in a room of soft curves.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I do not bring predictions, Your Majesty," Malakor said, his voice cutting through the ambient noise like a razor. "I bring a solution."
            </p>

            <p>
                The court quieted. The musicians paused.
            </p>

            <p>
                "A solution?" Queen Elara asked from the Moon Throne, her voice cool and skeptical. "To the weather?"
            </p>

            <p>
                "To the chaos," Malakor corrected. He unrolled a large scroll, not of parchment, but of a dark, heavy material he had fabricated in his labs. It slammed onto the marble floor with a heavy <em>thud</em> that made the nearest courtiers jump.
            </p>

            <p>
                He gestured, and the diagram upon it seemed to absorb the light of the room. It showed the binary system—the Gold and the Silver—bound in chains of dark geometric lines.
            </p>

            <p>
                "For a thousand years, we have lived at the mercy of celestial tantrums," Malakor declared, pacing around his diagram. "We feast when the Golden Sun is kind. We freeze when the Silver Sun turns away. We are pets, begging for scraps from the table of the stars."
            </p>

            <p>
                He looked up, meeting the King's eyes. "Why?"
            </p>

            <p>
                "Because that is the Balance," the King said, frowning. "Passion and Reason. Heat and Cold. Life requires both."
            </p>

            <p>
                "Life requires <em>consistency</em>," Malakor snapped. "I have calculated the trajectory. I have designed the ritual. We do not need two warring stars. We need one. A single, static point of light. Fixed. Eternal. Unchanging."
            </p>

            <p>
                He raised a hand, clenching it into a fist. "I propose we extinguish the consciousness of the stars. We strip them of their 'passion' and their 'reason' and leave only their power. We channel it into a single vessel. A battery. We can control the seasons. We can mandate the tides. We can create a perfect world where no child ever starves because a star felt <em>sad</em>."
            </p>

            <p>
                The silence that followed was not the respectful silence of awe. It was the horrified silence of blasphemy.
            </p>

            <p>
                "You speak of murder," Queen Elara whispered, gripping the arms of her throne. "You speak of killing the soul of the world."
            </p>

            <p>
                "I speak of <strong>Order</strong>!" Malakor's voice rose, cracking the veneer of his calm. "I speak of efficiency! What has 'soul' given us but uncertainty? What has 'beauty' given us but rot?"
            </p>

            <p>
                King Theron stood. The playfulness was gone from his face. The Golden Sun flared in the window behind him, casting a long, burning shadow over Malakor.
            </p>

            <p>
                "You are the High Sage," the King said, his voice low and dangerous. "Your duty is to interpret the light, Malakor. Not to enslave it."
            </p>

            <p>
                "Then the duty is flawed."
            </p>

            <p>
                "Leave us," the King commanded. "Take your dark scrolls and your cold mathematics and leave this city. Do not return until you have remembered what it means to be human."
            </p>

            <p>
                Malakor sneered. He rolled up his chart with methodical slowness. "Humanity," he scoffed, "is the variable I intend to correct."
            </p>

            <p>
                He turned on his heel and walked out of the hall. He did not look back at the light. He was already looking North, toward the wastes, where the shadows were long and the silence was absolute.
            </p>
