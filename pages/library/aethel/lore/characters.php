                <p>
                    Kaelan believes he is just a man born under a lucky star. He is wrong. He <strong class="text-uppercase">is</strong> the physical manifestation of <strong>Sol-Aura</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    His "rage" is not human anger; it is solar flaring. His strength is not muscle; it is gravity. Malakor cannot simply kill him, for doing so would destroy half the power source he needs to rule. He must be captured, contained, and controlled.

                <p>
                    She <strong class="text-uppercase">is</strong> the physical manifestation of <strong>Lun-Argent</strong>. Her "Hearth-Song" is the literal resonance of the silver star. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Captivity:</strong> Malakor's raid on Sunstead was a partial failure. He intended to seize both stars at once. Having only secured the Silver, he keeps her alive in the Highest Tower not as a hostage, but as bait. He knows that due to their celestial gravity, the Gold Sun (Kaelan) <em>must</em> eventually come to the Silver.

                            The Matriarch of Sunstead. In the days before the Gloom, she served the Old Court as a Royal Courier, memorizing every highway, goat path, and smuggler's tunnel in the kingdom.

                <p>
                    Before the Gloom fell, Seraphina was Kaelan's betrothed. She represented the "normal" life he thought he wanted. Malakor corrupted her with promises of eternal beauty and order—things a dying village could never provide. She now serves as Malakor's voice, trying to lure Kaelan into surrendering his power willingly.
